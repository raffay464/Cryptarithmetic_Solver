# Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver

## Description
This project is designed to solve cryptarithmetic puzzles, where each letter represents a unique digit and the goal is to find a valid mapping that satisfies the equation.  
The solver uses **DFS with Backtracking**, **Forward Checking**, and optionally **A* Search** for faster results.  

Examples of puzzles:
- `SEND + MORE = MONEY`
- `BASE + BALL = GAMES`

---

## Features
- Solves puzzles using DFS + Backtracking + Forward Checking.
- Implements an A* search with a heuristic for optimized solving.
- Outputs the mapping of letters to digits and verifies the equation.
- Supports customizable puzzles.
